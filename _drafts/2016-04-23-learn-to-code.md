*\"Rory, is coding easy?  If I want to learn how to code, where do I start? What language should I learn?\"*\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKIu9yen5nc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI get asked this question often enough that it's worth consolidating my advice and resources in one place.  This list of resources is by no means comprehensive, so I intend to continue to update this page regularly.  Send me an email if you think I'm missing something important, I'd love to hear about it!\n\nI've tried to make this as simple as possible, but I realize that this page is really dense and intimidating.\n\nThis is truthfully many months worth of reading and learning material, so take your time and work through them at your own comfortable pace.  [There's no shortcut to learning how to program.](http://abstrusegoose.com/249)\n\nWithout further ado...\n\n##Useful Websites\nBuckle up, here comes a ton of links.\n\n###Learning to Code\n\n* [Code.org](https://code.org/) - A good place to start, if you want to do an Hour of Code.  Very basic, but gives you a good grasp of how code executes.\n* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) - Gets into real languages you'd use. You writing code directly in text, not moving blocks around.  They have a number of courses, mostly centered around making webpages (HTML, Javascript, CSS, jQuery, SQL)\n* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - I haven't tried this site personally, but I've heard good things and they appear to have quite a few courses that look good.\n* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - Partners with Universities to offer courses online.\n* [edX](https://www.edx.org/) - Free online courses!  Sometimes you can earn University credit!\n* [Programming, Motherfucker](http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html) - A great resource with tons of links to free books!  For example, [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)\n* [The Computer Science Field Guide](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/) - An interactive textbook for for teaching Computer Science to students.  Very readable.\n* [A Visual Guide to Version Control](http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/) - version control is important and powerful tool to learn, and there are many versions, like programming languages.  It's essential to learn something like git if you plan to work on a project with multiple people in the future!\n* [From NAND to Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/) - Start from the very basics of hardware and build all the way up to an operating system and program.  Entirely self-contained - you can start this without knowing anything!\n* [awesome-courses](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses) - A GitHub repository with a list of awesome university courses and materials for learning Computer Science!\n\n###Exercises and Challenges\n\n* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - A great site with tons of interesting problems and puzzles for you to solve via code.  They start off fairly easy and rise in complexity.  You can probably start on the easiest challenges after spending a couple hours with the resources above!  Come back often and push your limits here.\n* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - Practice, compete, and collaborate on coding challenges.\n* [Github's Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) - You'll need to learn how to use git (or some over version control) so this is a good place to start!\n\n###Communities and Resources\n\n* [Github](https://github.com/) - I mention version control above.  Github lets you store your code for free online in repositories using git.  There's thousands of projects you can see publicly on Github, which you can build with, contribute to, or learn from!\n* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Every programming question ever has already been asked on this website.  There's a good chance you'll find this site again and again when Googling for help.\n* [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) - Another question/answer site.  Sometimes useful.\n* [reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/) - full of communities to help you learn to code, answer questions, keep up with news, etc. Check out: [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/), [/r/compsci](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/), [/r/netsec](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/), [/r/readablecode](https://www.reddit.com/r/readablecode/), [/r/tinycode](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinycode/), [/r/badcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/badcode/), [/r/programmingpuns](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingpuns/), [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)\n* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) - another content aggregator site where you can read about new technologies and programming articles. It's worth glancing at daily and reading anything that you find interesting.\n\n##Software and Tools\n\n###Software Bundles\n\n* [Microsoft DreamSpark](https://www.dreamspark.com/) - provides access to Microsoft software for learning, teaching and research purposes.  You might get this for free through your organization or school.\n* [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) - gives students free access to some excellent developer tools and services.\n\n###Tools\n\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - a free and open source distributed version control system \n\n###IDEs and editors\n\nAn IDE is an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment): a one-stop shop for writing, building, running, and debugging code!  Not necessary, but usually preferred.\n\n* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) - IntelliJ IDEA was one of my first IDEs, and I've used and loved PyCharm and WebStorm.  JetBrains makes good IDEs!  And they have free community editions and student packages.\n* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) - Microsoft's flagship IDE, now with [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/)! Very powerful, with support for everything you can think of!  It has a free community edition and a new lightweight \"Code\" edition.\n* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - \"a free (as in \"free speech\" and also as in \"free beer\") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages.\"\n* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - \"a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.  You'll love the slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance.\"\n* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - \"a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the core—a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.\"\n\n##General Advice and Opinions\n\n###\"I don't know what to code!\"\n\nMy best advice would be: try and conceive a small project that could prove useful or entertaining for you.  Then work at it until you get what you want!  All of my \"aha\" moments came working on my solo projects, totally unrelated to school or work.  I learned so much more with this hands on approach.\n\nWork until you are stumped, then search for help until you unblock yourself.  This continuous cycle of learning is actually quite exciting and engaging, if you enjoy the project.\n\nFor example, write a program to solve sudoku puzzles (or maybe one to generate puzzles!), or make a tool that saves you time inputting grades or calculating some values!  I would find excuses to code little things and I think that helped me get a good feel for my major quite early on.\n\nEventually you can move from smaller projects (like a program that helps you with the math on your chemistry homework) to larger ones (like a program that helps you automate actions in a game, or on a website) which can prove more useful.  Most recently, I wrote a small script on a Google Spreadsheet that notifies me when my website goes down unexpectedly!  Useful!\n\n[\"I know how to program, but I don't know what to program\"](http://www.devdungeon.com/content/i-know-how-program-i-dont-know-what-program)\n\n###\"What language should I use?\"\n\nIf you try a new language for each little project, you can quickly come to understand common ground between the languages, and build a nice collection of languages to list on your resume.\n\nUltimately most employers want smart people who can think of creatively.  You'll know the basics of programming, and you'll know how to approach problems well.  Most employers won't care if you don't know the specific language they use - in fact, you often won't.  That kind of knowledge is okay to learn on the job.  [Learn the fundamentals - the rest will change anyway!](https://twitter.com/hisham_hm/status/675845003709702144)\n\nYou will find there's a lot of opinions in this field.  *Everything* comes with a trade off.  Some languages might be higher-level and easier to comprehend.  They might require less work on your part - but they'll perform less quickly than lower-level languages that force you to get down and dirty with the code.  Some sorting functions will be faster than others... on average, but sometimes they might be terribly, terribly slow on certain data sets.  Some languages are more strict, others are more easy going or \"lazy\", or some have undefined behaviors that can become a confusing gray area if you're not careful.  Everything can be a pro or a con, depending on how you look at it.  Some problems lend themselves more towards different approaches for solutions - learning how to identify the problem and choose the best tool to tackle it is a key skill!\n\n[This infographic has some potentially helpful data on language usage.](http://fossbytes.com/how-to-pick-your-first-programming-language-4-different-ways/)\n\n##Switching Careers\n\nI think programming can be a fun hobby, so I'd encourage you to try it regardless and see how you feel about it.  If you're looking for a change in career and find you enjoy coding on the side, I think Software Engineering is a good field for you to consider.\n\nI know plenty of people who have successfully transitioned from other careers.  Unlike many other fields, it's fairly easy to get a feel for it on your own, and with enough motivation you can teach yourself 95% of what you need to know.  I know plenty of people employed at big companies who don't have a degree specifically in computer science, but something totally unrelated.\n\nIn fact, [a 2012 report from Microsoft](http://www.epi.org/publication/pm195-stem-labor-shortages-microsoft-report-distorts/) suggests that 60% of working Software Engineers do not have a Computer Science degree!  [Another study](http://www.wsj.com/articles/heres-a-thing-coders-can-skip-college-1427985222) found that there is simply no correlation between having a degree and being a good software engineer.\n\n>This is anecdotal and all, but I still find it funny that from the programmers I know, those without a degree tend to be the better ones. It seems in very often a degree is ends up used as a replacement for skill, rather than as proof of it. If someone got hired despite not having a degree, it's probably because they are quite good at what they do, for the rest the jury is still out. - /u/firecrack\n\nThe above quote is the [highest voted comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/41b3ej/60_of_working_software_engineers_do_not_have_a_cs/cz10jfl) in a discussion thread on /r/programming regarding the [estimated 1 million programming jobs](http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/12/unlocking-trapped-engineers/) in the US that are expected to go unfilled by 2020.  There is certainly opportunity.\n\nYou can learn to code.  You can get a job coding, and you can probably do it better than someone else is doing right now.  The only barrier is your own motivation!\n\nSo scroll up and click one of those website links *right now* and spend just 30 minutes on one.  **I dare you.**  The first step is the hardest.\n\n##Casual Learning\n\nSomething I highly encourage is casual reading and learning.  If you're vaguely interested in these things, there's lots of fascinating things to read about that aren't necessarily immediately relevant to your current project.  You'll learn interesting facts and tricks and expose yourself to new ways to approach problems.\n\n###Reading\n\n* [The fun of implementing date support](https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/6168031) - an extremely interesting read that shows you just how hard programming problems can be.  Even something as simple as representing dates can be a huge headache.  Then consider things like leap years (and leap seconds!), and how difficult it can be to synchronize clocks on GPS satellites hundreds of thousands of miles apart from each other!\n* [From 0 to cryptography](From 0 to cryptography) - Here's a good primer on cryptography: the study of developing techniques for private communication. If you understand this, you understand how you can exchange credit card details online worry-free, or how your iPhone protects your private data.\n* I'd also highly recommend reading about how programs can go disastrously wrong.  Like when they [overload electric utilities and cause a nationwide power outage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003), or when they [prevent a mars rover from booting properly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)#Sol_17_.28January_21.2C_2004.29_flash_memory_management_anomaly), or when they [administer too much cancer medication and kill patients](http://www.ccnr.org/fatal_dose.html), or [destroy a $300 million dollar Japanese satellite](http://hackaday.com/2016/05/02/software-update-destroys-286-million-japanese-satellite/)!\n* Speaking of programs going wrong, here are some of my favorite examples of weird and unexpected behaviors in common software:\n * [KB3053711](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3053711) - If your user name in Windows 8.1 contains \"user\", taskhost.exe goes crazy and wastes a bunch of CPU usage!\n * [KB977346](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/977346) - On Windows 7, if you set your background to a solid color, it takes 30 seconds longer to log in!\n * [KB168702](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/168702) - Sometimes when you return data from Microsoft Query 97 to a Microsoft Excel 97 worksheet, the spinning icon appears for a long time and then no data is loaded into the worksheet.  I like this one because of the recommended workaround: \n>If you move your mouse pointer continuously while the data is being returned to Microsoft Excel, the query may not fail. Do not stop moving the mouse until all the data has been returned to Microsoft Excel. \n* [Fast inverse square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root) - an inspiring function that demonstrates the genius we're all capable of when working under constraints.\n * (You should read [Masters of Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom).)\n* [The Infinitely Profitable Program](http://peetm.com/blog/?p=55) - thinking outside the box.\n* [We Who Value Simplicity Have Built Incomprehensible Machines](http://prog21.dadgum.com/139.html) - this guy blogs every now and then.
